# Data-Preprocessing

Data Preprocessing tools 


a) Taking care of missing data
b) Encoding the categorical variables - Independent and dependent variables
c)

Split the dataset into training and test sets - train the model to understand the correlation b/w variables in the dataset
test - to test the performance of the model

If the model is trained too well i.e. it fits the training data better but doesn't perform well on test set - overfitting
vice versa is underfitting

Feature scaling - scales all the features to make sure they are on the right scale
